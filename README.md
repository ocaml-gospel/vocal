# Vocal

**Disclamer:** This project is still experimental. No support will be provided
at this point, and its interface is still unstable.

Vocal is a set of OCaml modules, formally verified using
[Gospel](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel) and various tools
(currently, [Why3](https://why3.lri.fr),
[CFML](https://www.chargueraud.org/softs/cfml/),
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)).
